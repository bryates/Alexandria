The READMEs for each of my personal GitHub projects are loaded into ChromDB. I then create a fake job posting
>"This job requires experience with machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and large language models (LLMs) such as GPT.
Also Deep Learning, Python, and cloud platforms like AWS or GCP?"

The RAG returns:

=== LLM Summary ===<br>
Here are your top 2 relevant projects:

**1. Integrating documents into large language models (LLMs)**
*   Developed a system using Python (LangChain) to integrate proprietary documents with LLMs (Google Gemini, with support for GPT-4/Claude) for efficient information retrieval.
*   Addressed the challenge of quickly accessing information from 100+ page internal documents, leveraging prompt engineering.
*   Designed an object-oriented architecture for document management, extendable to various data sources (PDFs, emails, databases).

**2. Using Deep Neural Networks to Reconstruct Intermediate Particles**
*   Engineered and trained a Deep Neural Network in PyTorch to reconstruct intermediate particles from high-dimensional data, achieving R² ≥ 0.9.
*   Demonstrated expertise in scalable model deployment by containerizing the solution with Docker and deploying on AWS EC2.
*   Applied deep learning techniques to complex, noisy data, with direct relevance to predictive maintenance, fraud detection, and anomaly detection.
