Collection:
*   "Measurement of the Shape of the b Quark Fragmentation Function Using Charmed Mesons in Proton-Proton Collisions at a Center of Mass-Energy of 13 TeV" by Brent R. Yates

Here's a summary of the key points from the document, focusing on measurement, results, and conclusion:

*   **Objective:** The dissertation focuses on measuring the shape parameter *rb* in the Lund-Bowler fragmentation function for b quarks produced in top-antitop (tt) events. These collisions occurred at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV and were detected by the CMS detector. The 
analysis seeks to improve the precision of *rb* measurements and explore the color environment invariance of the fragmentation process.

*   **Methodology:**

    *   **Data Source:** The analysis uses the full 2016 dataset from the CMS detector, with an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb⁻¹.
    *   **Event Selection:** The study uses charmed mesons (D0 and J/ψ) produced in the leptonic decays of tt events as proxies for the parent b quark.
    *   **Proxy Variable:** The ratio *xB* (the transverse momentum (pT) of the charmed meson divided by the sum of pT of all charged particles in the jet containing the meson) is used to measure *rb*.
    *   **Data Analysis and Background Subtraction:** The sPlot technique is used to subtract background.

*   **Measurement and Results:**

    *   The shape parameter *rb* is measured individually for different charmed meson channels: J/ψ, D0, and D0µ.
    *   The combined measurement of *rb* is: 0.841 ± 0.014 (stat) ± 0.010 (syst) +0.033/-0.026 (fsr).

*   **Conclusion:** The study achieved a more precise measurement of the fragmentation shape parameter *rb* compared to previous e+e- collider experiments. The consistency with previous measurements suggests that the fragmentation process is independent of the color environment.
